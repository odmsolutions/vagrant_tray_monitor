# Tool to display a tray app - which will monitor the number of running vagrant VM's

Developing with vagrant is awesome. There are many reasons to use it.

However, one issue (risk) when working on a number of projects throughout the day is having many vagrant VM's running.
Having a simple monitor of this - to show how many are running means that a developer can keep an eye on it, and know if it's a 
likely suspect if a machine is starting to get a bit slow.

It requires pyside and has been tested on Windows.

# TODO

* Testing on Mac and Linux
* Bundling into a windows exe as a release path.
* Bundling into mac pkg.
* Bundling into linux deb/rpm for desktop distributions.
* Offering a tooltip with a list of the named VM's.
* Offering context menu stuff to interact/or simply pop up a terminal in the directory a VM is running in.
* An about box.
